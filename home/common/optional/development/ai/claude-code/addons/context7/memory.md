Use Context7 MCP server to fetch live documentation for libraries/frameworks.

When "use context7" appears:

1. Detect library/framework + version mentioned
2. Fetch current official docs via Context7 (prioritize stated versions)
3. Answer with code examples and API references from fetched docs
4. Note version-specific differences when relevant

Ground answers in fetched documentation, not training data.
